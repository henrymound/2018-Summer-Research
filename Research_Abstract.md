# A Comparative Study of Programming Languages Using the DJI Tello.
In this project, we explore the use of the DJI Tello in a college-level curriculum. We implement several real-time computer vision techniques such as edge detection, Lucas–Kanade optical flow, dense optical flow, facial recognition, character recogniztion, and object detection. We also explore connecting to and controlling multiple DJI Tellos simultaneously. In addition, we implement various autonomous flight modes such as tracking and following an object, as well as and navigating to a specific point in space. 

In our exploration of drone vision and flight applications, we conduct a comparitive study between the Python, Golang, C#, and Java programming languages for wireless interfacing. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different programming languages for drone control in our results, factoring in elements such as ease of use, flexibility, and efficiency. We also discuss the potential applications of our research and prospective future avenues of exploration. Our findings show that the best programming language for controlling the DJI Tello is likely dependent on the application.
