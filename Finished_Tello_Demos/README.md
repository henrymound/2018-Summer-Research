# Finished Tello Demos
All of these scripts are written in Python and use dependencies that require some packages to be installed either using ```brew``` or ```pip```. These files also use local python files stored in the **lib** folder.
All controller input has only been tested using an XBox One controller and the MacOS controller driver. The lates driver can be installed [here](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases).
