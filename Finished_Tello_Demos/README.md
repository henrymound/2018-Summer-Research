# Finished Tello Demos
All of these scripts are written in Python and use dependencies that require some packages to be installed either using ```brew``` or ```pip```. These programs also use local python scripts stored in the **lib** folder.

All controller input has only been tested using an XBox One controller and the MacOS controller driver. The lates driver can be installed [here](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases).

# Gui.py
This is a gui-based python app that grants full access to the Ryze Tello. This program supports game controller input for XBox One ([Mac users need to install the drivers](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases)), Dualshock 3, and Dualshock 4. This app also grants full video stream access as well as some opencv-based image processing. *Gui.py* also supports taking pictures and all 8-direction flips.

Here are some screenshots of *Gui.py* in action:
